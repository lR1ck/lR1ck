## Hello there 👋
# Hey, I'm Ricardo (aka R1ck)

> “I don’t build software to follow the rules — I build it to rewrite them.”

I’m a Software Engineer passionate about **AI**, **automation**, and **scalable backend architecture**.  
I like building products that feel invisible but do heavy lifting behind the scenes.
